# DreamingOfTech
Public website for dreaming of tech built in Node

Using a free HTML5 template (as I am not skilled in CSS) this website is to hold the following components:
* Home page
* Contact Me
  - nodemailer
  - validation
* Blog
  - This is to be built from scratch so styling can be as I would like.
  - Simple design (initially):
    - posts page
    - posts list
    - categories / tags
    - tag cloud (RiTa.js)
  - Additional
    - Comments
    - Sharing Buttons
* Links to help system
* Coding Examples
* Google Analytics

Other components that I would like to include:
* Twitter Bot to post regularly to twitter
