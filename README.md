# DreamingOfTech
Public website for dreaming of tech built in Node

Using a free HTML5 template (as I am not skilled in CSS) this website is to hold the following components:
* Home page
* Contact Me
* Blog
* Links to help system
* Coding Examples

Other components that I would like to include:
* Twitter Bot to post regularly to twitter
