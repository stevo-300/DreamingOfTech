Essentially Voldermorts story back to power... with a twist.
Complete memory loss with flashes of memory hitting at certain intervals.

The flashes can carry hidden messages and puzzles to be deciphered



Start as an esper:
1) regain a form
  - Stages
  - increasing sizes of animal aiming for human
  - find clues / resources to construct method of increasing status
  - magical/technology?? combinations??

2) light vs dark decisions.
  - flashes show dark past
  - people in the world start terrified of your name
  - 

3) Allies
  - Old vs New
  - dark allies to assist, ability to use them to proceed down the light path..

4) decisions matter
  - light counter
  - magic ability counter
  - tech ability counter
  - items/abilities based upon the balance of the 2 abilities

  (mixed abilities ultimately the strongest, but more difficult path?) - 'gym training mechanic'

5) Dev plan...

find means of progression 
  - 1 free 'action' ever hour
  - 1 action available every 15 minutes


devise initial story elements (chapters) and resources / knowledge to complete them
